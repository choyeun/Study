# Quantifiers

A [[propositional function]] P(x) is a statement involving a variable x
- For example: P(x): 2x is an even [[정수|integer]]
Domain of a propositional function
- if x is an element of [[집합|Set]] D, D is called the domain of P(x)
	- For example, x is a element of the [[집합|Set]] of [[정수|integer]]s
- the domain D of P(x) must be defined
	- (cf) P(x): x is an even [[정수|integer]]
		- if D is a [[집합|Set]] of even [[정수|integer]]s
		- if D is a [[집합|Set]] of odd [[정수|integer]]
